The optional-silence phone sil occupies 23.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 82.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 6.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 10.0 hours of data, or 7.7 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 3.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (14,24.4,78)
